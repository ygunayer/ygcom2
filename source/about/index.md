Welcome! I’m Yalın, a software engineer based in Turkey, and this is my personal website where I post blog articles about video games, programming, and the software industry in general.

## About Me
I hold a bachelor's degree in computer engineering and a master's degree in business administration, and I currently work at [Craftbase](https://craftbase.io/) as a full-time software developer.

I thrive in well-designed, well-architectured, and technology-rich software, and while I'm mostly interested concurreny, functional programming, and game development, I keep challenging myself by trying to learn different programming languages with different paradigms and/or design principles.

Professionally, I'm most proficient in web development and high-level software architectures, but I've also had substantial experience in building highly-concurrent desktop applications. If you're interested in more details, feel free to contact me at [GitHub](https://github.com/ygunayer) or [LinkedIn](https://tr.linkedin.com/in/ygunayer).

## About the Website
The website is built with the static content generator [Hexo](https://hexo.io), and a modified version of its beautiful [Apollo](https://github.com/pinggod/hexo-theme-apollo) theme. The source code is available on Github at [ygunayer/ygcom2](https://github.com/ygunayer/ygcom2) for the website and content, and [ygunayer/yg-apollo](https://github.com/ygunayer/yg-apollo) for the modified version of the theme.
