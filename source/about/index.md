Welcome to my website! I’m Yalın, a software engineer. I hold a bachelor's degree in computer engineering and a master's degree in business administration, and I currently work at [EmlakJet](http://emlakjet.com/) as a full-time web developer.

I thrive in well-designed, well-architectured and technology-rich software, and I consider myself as a polyglot/language-agnostic developer since I can easily adapt to any programming language or paradigm in a short manner of time. Although I'm most proficient in web development and high-level software architectures, I've had substantial experience in highly-concurrent desktop application development, and I'm also very interested in video game development, functional programming and actor-based software systems (Scala, Akka, et al.). For a more detailed information about my work, feel free to request a resumé.

#### About the Website
This website serves as a personal blog where I post about video games, programming, and the software industry in general. I realize that at this point the blog is a little bit too short on content, but that is something I intend and hope to fix in the near future by writing more articles.

Technically, the website's built with the static content generator [Hexo](https://hexo.io), and a modified version of its beautiful [Apollo](github.com/pinggod/hexo-theme-apollo) theme. The source code is available on Github at [ygunayer/ygcom2](https://github.com/ygunayer/ygcom2) for the website and content, and [ygunayer/yg-apollo](https://github.com/ygunayer/yg-apollo) for the modified version of the theme.
